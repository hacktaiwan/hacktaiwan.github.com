    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wanted to draw up a provisional schedule, so that we can have some feedback about the plans. Since it is a single day event, the time is limited. There should be enough time to create something new and cool, though, even with those limitations. That probably means early start (and loads of coffee), but not too late finish. People will be exhausted pretty quickly with that much brainwork, will probably make an interesting Saturday night afterwards</p>

<h1>Overall scedule for Hack+Taiwan on April 21</h1>

<ul>
<li>9:00 - Doors open,</li>
<li>9:30 - Kick off, intro</li>
<li>10:00 - Team formation, ready to rock</li>
<li>17:00 - Presentations of the day&#8217;s results, votig, winners</li>
<li>18:00 - Closing down, some networking, mingling time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kick off</h2>

<p>Starting early (for <a href="http://taipei.startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend Taipei</a> we had to be there 8am sharp) is not a bad thing. Will check to arrange some breakfast and some pick-me-up for people. Might open the doors earlier than 9am, and see how people arrive. Whatever happens, should get on the way pretty soon, not to waste valuable hacking time</p>

<h2>Intro, team formation</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m still figuring out the exact format of the day. Likely will take the <em>all bets are off</em> shape: whatever&#8217;s your language, whatever you want to hack on, team up with a couple of other people (maybe 2-3 people teams, that should be small enough but inspiring), and get on with it.</p>

<h2>During the day</h2>

<p>Planning to invite some technical mentors, who might be useful to give some ideas, feedback and motivation. They can maybe join the teams here and there for a while before moving on another one. Only thing I&#8217;m worried about is that it might be a too small scale event, don&#8217;t want them to get bored. At StartupWeekend the mentors were doing a lot of standing around, that&#8217;s not a valuable use of their time.</p>

<p>For the rest of the time between 10:00-17:00, besides having a giant countdown showing somewhere, will have some food and drinks to keep everyone happy, and will see what other problems we (organizers) will have to solve.</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>

<p>Depending on the number of teams, every team will have about 3-5 minutes to present their idea and progress. Whether they got far, whether they got stuck, all is interesting. Just share and give us some feel what inspired them. Everyone who&#8217;s present can vote for the best hack, and hoping to have some technical judges who can give out titles in their field or choose their favorites. This time no prizes for winning, though I&#8217;ll definitely be spreading the word that you kick ass if you do. You know what, if you get as far as the presentations, I&#8217;ll spread the world that you kick ass.</p>

<h2>Closing down</h2>

<p>This whole day is just as much about people as about creating new things, hope to bring a great and creative coding community together, so after the presentations and votes finished, hope we can stick around and know each other a bit more, until next time.</p>

<h1>Thoughts?</h1>

<p>Any feedback is welcome, so far we are winging it, let us know if something could be planned better. Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s plenty to do since only 9 days left till we should get on the way. For any hackathon, the most important ingredient is hackers (<em>duh!</em>), so currently I&#8217;m focusing on getting people interested in this event, if we have a good crowd, everything else will almost take care of itself (I imagine/hope).</p>

<h2>Application form</h2>

<p><strong>Very important</strong>: To apply, please fill out the application form at <a href="http://goo.gl/SrvBc">http://goo.gl/SrvBc</a>, and pass the address on to others who are interested as well. It&#8217;s not enough to just click &#8220;join&#8221; on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/382147041825676/">Facebook event page</a>.</p>

<p><img class="Logo" src="http://hacktaiwan.github.com/myimg/ApplicationForm.png" title="Application form" ></p>

<p>So far I&#8217;m reaching out directly to different groups as well, for example the <a href="http://taipei.startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend Taipei</a> folks we had an awesome event with two weeks ago, and to the Open Source Developers&#8217; Conference <a href="http://osdc.tw/">OSDC.TW</a> people who seem very well suited for this. Any more ideas who to approach? Just leave me a message, any feedback is appreciated.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>Things to take care of at the moment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find technical mentors / judges</li>
<li>Find technical sponsors</li>
<li>Figure out catering (pizza+coffee, anyone?)</li>
<li>Set up infrastructure, tools for the day</li>
<li>Get a timetable for the day</li>
<li>Let the event info out to the media to build some buzz</li>
</ul>


<p>At least the venue I don&#8217;t have to worry about, <a href="http://appworks.tw">AppWorks</a> kindly let us use their <a href="http://appworks.tw/incubator/">inclubator space</a>, should be nice, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1815435503043542231">downtown Taipei</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everything starts somewhere, though not everything has this little time to prepare for that dramatic event of &#8220;coming into this world&#8221;. Next week - or rather in a few days, from this Suday - it is the <a href="http://www.creativityday.org/About.html">World Creativity and Innovation Week</a>, between April 15 - 21. Looked like a fun thing to do, and my friend suggested that we could do something for <a href="http://playtivity.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/world-creativity-and-innovation-week-april-15-21-%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%89%B5%E6%84%8F%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E9%80%B1/">Taiwan</a> as well, despite the short notice.</p>

<p>Sure, I like a challenge, so came up with two events, one of them being this one, Hack+Taiwan - a Taiwan-themed hackathon.</p>

<p><img class="Logo" src="http://hacktaiwan.github.com/myimg/Logo2_small.png" width="400" height="400" title="Hack+Taiwan logo" ></p>

<p>The idea behind this event is that while I feel Taiwan is very advanced in terms of computing, mobile phone, TV, internet connections, general computer literacy, the services provided on the net are lagging behind quite a lot. From the US and other places we have many interesting and useful services, people often create lots of small projects as well that are immensely useful, in the meantime in Taiwan most companies are running websites with very old and inconvenient technologies, data providers hardly heard of APIs, and things often more complicated to do than they should be.</p>

<p>We can change that, we can tie things together to enable people to do more, and make this island an even more fun place to be. There are plenty of good developers, plenty of opportunities to improve, just people need that little push. Let&#8217;s show the world that Ilha Formosa is not just beautiful but very clever as well!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a very short notice event (I know I have said that already), so not sure how it will work out, but will give it my most and should be a fun time.</p>

<p>Will post here a sign-up sheet, and more information shortly. For additional info, you can see the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/382147041825676/">Facebook event page</a> as well. Spread the word and let us have a blast!</p>
